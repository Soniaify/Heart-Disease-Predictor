    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        This little app is like a <strong>smart doctor friend</strong>. It helps you check if someone might have heart disease — just by answering a few health questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        But don’t worry! You don’t need to be a doctor, and you don’t need to understand big medical words. Just follow the steps and answer the questions as best as you can.
    </p>

    <p>
        This app uses something called <strong>machine learning</strong>, which means it has looked at lots and lots of health records before, and it has learned how to spot signs of heart problems.
    </p>

    <h2> What You Need to Do</h2>

    <p>Using the app is very easy — just like filling a form:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open the App:</strong> Run the app, and it will open in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Out the Health Form:</strong> You’ll answer questions like:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> How old are you?</li>
        <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Are you Male or Female?</li>
        <li><strong>Chest Pain Type:</strong> Do you feel chest pain?</li>
        <li><strong>Resting Blood Pressure:</strong> What is your blood pressure?</li>
        <li><strong>Cholesterol:</strong> How much fat is in your blood?</li>
        <li><strong>Fasting Blood Sugar:</strong> Is your blood sugar more than 120 before eating? (Yes or No)</li>
        <li><strong>Resting ECG Result:</strong> What does your heart test look like when you’re not moving? (Normal or ST-T wave abnormality)</li>
        <li><strong>Max Heart Rate Achieved:</strong> How fast does your heart beat when you exercise a lot?</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Induced Angina:</strong> Do you get chest pain when you exercise? (Yes or No)</li>
        <li><strong>Oldpeak (ST Depression):</strong> How much does your heart signal drop when under stress?</li>
        <li><strong>Slope of ST Segment:</strong> What shape does your heart signal take? (Upsloping, Flat, Downsloping)</li>
        <li><strong>Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy:</strong> How many big heart blood tubes are blocked? (0 to 3)</li>
        <li><strong>Thalassemia:</strong> What kind of red blood cell condition do you have? (Normal, Fixed Defect, Reversible Defect)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>Click "Predict":</strong> The app will think for a second and give you a result like:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>You don’t have heart disease</li>
        <li>Your heart disease is mild</li>
        <li>Your heart disease is moderate</li>
        <li>Your heart disease is severe</li>
        <li>Your heart disease is very severe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What Is It Doing Behind the Scenes?</h2>
    <p>
        When you click “Predict,” the app checks your answers and compares them to thousands of examples it has learned from.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s like a smart memory that helps decide what your results might be.
    </p>

    <h2> A Final Note from the App</h2>
    <p>
        I’m not a real doctor — just a smart helper. If I say you might have heart disease, don’t panic! Go see a real doctor for proper care and advice.
